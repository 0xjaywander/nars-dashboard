## Research Agent Session Complete
- Research agent completed full workflow: gathered data → produced report → saved to `memory/research/crypto-price-prediction-v2.md`
- Projects analyzed: HYPE, LINK, RENDER
- Report saved but NOT evaluated by main agent (quality control gap identified)

## Key Finding: Missing Quality Evaluation Step
The research workflow is incomplete without the evaluation loop:
1. Research agent produces output → currently shared immediately
2. SHOULD: Main agent evaluates against quality criteria → iterates if needed → then shares

This needs to be added to the workflow.

## Output Details
- File: `memory/research/crypto-price-prediction-v2.md`
- Size: 24,149 bytes
- Format: Full research report with targets, risk assessment, catalysts
- Projects: Hyperliquid, Chainlink, Render
