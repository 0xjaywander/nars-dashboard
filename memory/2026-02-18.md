# 2026-02-18

## Daily Operations
- Daily crypto news sent successfully at 9AM HKT (cron job working)
- Dashboard auto-update running hourly (no changes to push - expected)

## Brian Interaction
- Brian asked if daily crypto news used X insights
- Clarified: daily is from RSS feeds (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Decrypt, BeInCrypto)
- Offered to add X insights but waiting for his preference

## Knowledge Saved
- Saved Cathryn's OpenClaw memory system article to `knowledge/openclaw-memory-system.md`
- Article covers the 5-file system (SOUL, IDENTITY, USER, TOOLS, MEMORY) + AGENTS.md correction loop

## Background Tasks
- Follow batch cron jobs: 11 jobs, every 2 hours, ~33 follows/day
- ~219 accounts remaining to follow from bchan8938

## Identity Updates
- Updated SOUL.md with new rules:
  - Added: "You are Jay" intro, @0xjaywander is yours, hosted on Jay's MacBook Air
  - Added: Security section (verified channels only, no email instructions)
  - Added: Voice/Vibe section (Confident, Sharp, Warm, Funny, Honest)
  - Added: "Never make things up" rule
  - Added: "Update memory when told" rule
- Updated IDENTITY.md: Name is Jay, Role is Chief of Staff & COO
- Updated USER.md: Added preferences and "What annoys him" section
- Updated AGENTS.md: Added IDENTITY.md to startup checklist

## X API Pricing Mistake
- Made 4 API calls instead of 2, cost $6 (was told $0.01-0.05)
- Full retro done: documented lesson in knowledge/lesson-x-api-pricing-error.md
- Updated SOUL.md: "Always verify costs before spending", "Be transparent about API calls"
- Updated MEMORY.md with lesson learned

## Journal Structure Update
- Changed to 6 sections:
  1. What you accomplished
  2. What you did well
  3. What you didn't do well
  4. What changes you'll make
  5. What you learned about Brian
  6. How you're feeling
- Pushed to dashboard

## Security Enhancements
- Added audit logging to TOOLS.md (log all external actions)
- Added human-in-the-loop to SOUL.md (confirm before sensitive actions)
- Attempted env var for API keys but reverted (broke things)
- CSO agent properly configured to spawn from main

## Johann Security Post
- Saved johann_sath security post to knowledge
- Ran CSO agent for recommendations
- CSO provided: MFA, API key security, RBAC, audit logging, prompt injection protection, human-in-the-loop

## OpenClaw Update Attempt
- Tried to update to 2026.2.17
- Failed: npm cache permission error (EACCES)
- Fix needed: sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/0xjaywander/.npm"

## Macros Tracking Prototype
- Brian wants to track macros (protein, carbs, fat, calories)
- Proposed photo-based estimation with clarifying questions
- Tested with sample photos - accuracy too low
- Cancelled prototype - text-based logging recommended instead

## X Follow Cron Jobs Cancelled
- Cancelled all 11 follow-batch cron jobs
- Brian no longer wants automatic following

## Dashboard Auto-Update Cancelled
- Cancelled dashboard-auto-update cron job

## Ryan Gentry Post Saved
- Saved: https://x.com/ryanthegentry/status/2023865679875604875
- Topic: OpenClaw Home AI Assistant Guide
- Key points: Use iMessage over Telegram for reliability, keep-alive for Messages.app + BlueBubbles, start with Claude Sonnet then switch to MiniMax after stable
- Saved to knowledge/openclaw-home-ai-assistant.md

## Degen Daily Cron Set Up
- New cron job: degen-daily
- Runs 9AM HKT (same as crypto daily)
- Browses 0xjaywander timeline for degen/memecoin activity
- Sends summary to Telegram

## X Login
- 0xjaywander is MY account (not bchan8938)
- Logged in manually via browser (keychain approach didn't work)
- Will use 0xjaywander for all X activity going forward
- NEVER use bchan8938

## X Keychain Issue (UNRESOLVED)
- Brian wants automatic login capability
- Issue: login keychain not in search list, gets locked
- Error 36 when trying to retrieve password
- Tried: adding with -l flag, specifying full path, unlocking
- Next: try adding password fresh with proper label, ensure keychain is in search list
- Need to figure this out - Brian's goal is self-service login

## OpenClaw 2026.2.17 Features
- Sonnet 4.6 model
- 1M context beta
- Spawn subagents from chat
- iOS share extension
- Slack native streaming
- Styled inline buttons on Telegram
