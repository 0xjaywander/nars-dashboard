## Fix: Daily Crypto News Not Delivering to Telegram

**Problem:** The cron job for daily crypto news (9AM HKT) was running but failing to deliver messages to Brian's Telegram.

**Root Cause:** The cron job payload instructed the agent to "send to Brian via Telegram" but didn't include the chat ID. The `message` tool requires a target (`chat_id`), and without it, the message couldn't be sent.

**Discovery Process:**
1. Reviewed cron job configuration at 9AM HKT
2. Found isolated session transcript showing failed message attempts
3. Identified error: "Action send requires a target"
4. Tried sending "Brian" as target → failed ("Unknown target")
5. Successfully sent test message using the current chat ID from metadata

**Solution:**
- Discovered Brian's Telegram chat ID: `5127620137`
- Updated cron job payload to include explicit chat ID instruction
- Tested successfully by sending Feb 15 crypto news

**Key Learning:** When using OpenClaw's message tool in automated/cron contexts, chat IDs must be explicitly provided. The current conversation context works because OpenClaw knows the source, but cron jobs (isolated sessions) need the target explicitly configured.

**Files Modified:**
- Cron job `6a47e385-330b-4f9e-b359-86fac07eae5e` updated with chat_id: 5127620137
