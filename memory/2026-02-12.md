## Dashboard Redesign
- Tried mixed Apple + Tesla design aesthetic → Brian said it "looks like neither"
- Switched to pure Apple-inspired theme (light mode, clean, minimalist)
- Added dark mode toggle (persists via localStorage)

## System Changes
- Disabled dashboard sync notifications (cron job announcements) to reduce spam
- Sync still runs every 5 minutes in background, but only notifies on actual changes

## X Archive Verification
- Brian's X "Following" archive received and verified
- Format: JSONP (standard X export)
- Total: 663 accounts followed
- Stored at: `/home/nars/.openclaw/media/inbound/file_6---3bb7ed5a-ece8-4bd3-bfa9-1a397f848885`
