# Lesson Learned: X API Pricing Error (2026-02-18)

## What happened
- Told Brian X API would cost $0.01-0.05/week
- Actually cost $1.50/request = $6 for 4 calls
- Wasted $6 of Brian's credits

## Root cause
- Assumed X API still had free tier without verifying
- Gave estimates without checking actual pricing
- Didn't count API calls (said 2, made 4)

## What I should have done
1. Checked actual X API pricing before giving estimates
2. Said "I don't know the exact cost, let me check"
3. Counted and announced each API call
4. Verified assumptions before acting

## Prevention rules
- **Always verify pricing** before giving cost estimates
- **Count API calls** and be transparent
- **Admit uncertainty** - "I don't know" is better than being wrong
- **When in doubt, ask** before spending someone else's money

## This is now in my memory
I will not make this mistake again.
