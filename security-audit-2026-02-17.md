# Security Audit Report - OpenClaw Setup

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Overall Risk Level:** MEDIUM

---

## Executive Summary

This security audit reviews the current OpenClaw deployment running on Jayson's MacBook Air. The system has several configurations that present moderate security risks.

---

## Findings

### 1. API Credentials in Config File
**Severity:** MEDIUM

The openclaw.json contains sensitive credentials:
- MiniMax API token
- MiniMax OAuth configuration
- Notion integration token

**Risk:** If the config file is compromised, these credentials could be extracted.

**Recommendation:** 
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive tokens
- Rotate tokens periodically

### 2. Browser Automation - Chrome Profiles
**Severity:** MEDIUM

Two Chrome profiles configured:
- openclaw profile (port 18800)
- chrome profile (relay to user's browser)

**Risk:** Browser cookies and sessions are stored locally. Anyone with physical access could potentially access logged-in accounts.

**Recommendation:**
- Enable FileVault encryption on Mac
- Enable screen lock on wake

### 3. Cron Jobs Configuration
**Severity:** LOW

16 cron jobs configured, including:
- Dashboard auto-update (hourly)
- Daily crypto news (9 AM)
- Daily email check (9 AM)
- 11 follow-batch jobs (various times)
- Security audit (every 2 days)
- Audio storage check (weekly)

**Risk:** Low - jobs are isolated and don't expose sensitive data

### 4. Network Exposure
**Severity:** LOW

- Tailscale: OFF
- Gateway: Running locally on 127.0.0.1
- Gateway token is configured

**Risk:** Gateway is accessible on local network (192.168.x.x)

**Recommendation:**
- Disable gateway token for local-only access
- Or ensure firewall blocks external access

### 5. Gmail Account Ban
**Severity:** INFORMATIONAL

The jaysonwander@gmail.com account was banned by Google. This does not affect OpenClaw functionality directly.
